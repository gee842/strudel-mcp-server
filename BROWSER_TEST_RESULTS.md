## Code Examples That Work

### Simple Pattern
```javascript
s("bd*4, ~ cp ~ cp").swing(0.1)
```

### Generated Techno Pattern
```javascript
// techno pattern in C at 130 BPM
setcpm(130)

stack(
  // Drums
  s("bd*4, ~ cp ~ cp, [~ hh]*4, oh ~ ~ ~").swing(0.05),
  
  // Bass
  note("c2 c2 c2 c2").s("sawtooth").cutoff(800),
  
  // Chords
  note("C" "C" "Eb" "C").s("sawtooth").struct("1 ~ 1 ~").release(0.1).gain(0.6),
  
  // Melody
  note("c3 d#4 d#3 c4 g3 c3 g4 d#4").s("triangle").struct("~ 1 ~ 1 1 ~ 1 ~").delay(0.25).room(0.3).gain(0.5)
).gain(0.8)
```

### DnB with Bass
```javascript
stack(
  s("bd ~ ~ [bd bd] ~ ~ bd ~, ~ ~ cp ~ [~ cp] ~ cp ~ ~, hh*16").fast(2),
  note("e1 ~ ~ e2 ~ e1 ~ ~").s("square").cutoff(400)
)
```
